Adeloop provides all the familiar Jupyter-like features you expect, enhanced with cloud capabilities for improved performance and collaboration.

![Jupyter Features](/notebook_cells.png)

## Variable Persistence

Just like in Jupyter notebooks, variables defined in one cell execution persist across subsequent executions.

```python
# Cell 1
x = 10
y = 20

# Cell 2 (can access x and y from previous cell)
z = x + y
print(z)  # Output: 30
```

This persistence allows you to build complex analyses incrementally, running and refining parts of your code without losing your workspace state.

## Execution Count Tracking

Each code execution is assigned a sequential execution count (1, 2, 3, ...), displayed in brackets just like Jupyter:

```
[1] x = 10
[2] y = 20
[3] print(x + y)  # Output: 30
```

Execution counts help you track the order of operations and reference specific cell executions in your workflow.

## Rich Output Support

Adeloop supports various types of rich output including:

### DataFrames with HTML Formatting
When you assign a pandas DataFrame to the `result` variable, it's automatically displayed in an interactive table format.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 28],
    'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Tokyo', 'Paris']
})

# Display as rich output
result = df
```

### Matplotlib and Plotly Figures
Visualizations are automatically rendered inline:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create and display plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('X values')
plt.ylabel('Y values')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Images and Tables
Various other output types are supported with enhanced formatting.

## Magic Commands

Adeloop supports Jupyter-like magic commands that provide enhanced functionality:

### %who
List all variable names in the current namespace:
```python
x = 10
y = "hello"
%who  # Output: x y
```

### %whos
List variables with details including types and sizes:
```python
%whos
# Output:
# Variable    Type         Size/Value
# ------------------------------------
# x           int          10
# y           str          hello
```

### %history
Show execution history with code snippets:
```python
%history
```

### %ls
List directory contents:
```python
%ls
```

### %pwd
Print working directory:
```python
%pwd
```

### %reset
Reset the namespace (clear all variables):
```python
%reset
```

## Shell Command Support

Execute shell commands using the `!` prefix with enhanced output capture:

```python
!ls -la
!echo "Hello World"
!pwd
!date
```

Shell commands properly capture both stdout and stderr output for comprehensive system interaction.

## Streaming Output

Real-time output streaming for long-running processes, similar to Jupyter notebooks:

```python
import time

# Simulate a long-running process
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"Processing step {i}...")
    time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second
    
print("Process completed!")
```

Streaming output allows you to monitor the progress of lengthy computations directly in the notebook.

## Namespace Management

Adeloop provides robust namespace management that:
- Preserves variables across executions
- Prevents namespace corruption
- Supports variable inspection
- Offers recovery mechanisms

## Execution History

Complete execution history tracking includes:
- Code snippets for each execution
- Timestamps
- Execution counts
- Variable state at each execution

Access your execution history with the `%history` magic command.

## Error Handling

Enhanced error handling with:
- Detailed traceback information
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Clear error messages for debugging

```python
# Example of error handling
undefined_variable + 10  # This will produce a clear error message
```

## Example Notebook

Try this example to see multiple Jupyter-like features in action:

```python
# Example demonstrating multiple features
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create sample data
data = {
    'Product': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
    'Sales': [100, 150, 120, 200, 180],
    'Profit': [20, 30, 25, 40, 35]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display DataFrame (rich output)
print("Sales Data:")
result = df

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df['Product'], df['Sales'], color='skyblue')
plt.title('Product Sales')
plt.xlabel('Product')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()

# Use magic commands
%who
%whos

# Show current directory
%pwd

# List files
%ls
```

This example demonstrates variable persistence, rich output for DataFrames and plots, and several magic commands all working together seamlessly.
